## 📋 What is Bachelor Meal System?

**Bachelor Meal System** is a web-based application designed to manage daily meals, bazar expenses, and monthly cost calculations for shared living spaces like bachelor flats or hostels.

### The Problem We Solve

Living in a bachelor flat with multiple roommates? Then you know the struggle:

- 🤯 **Confusing meal calculations** — Who ate how many meals this month?
- 💸 **Bazar cost tracking nightmare** — Who paid for groceries? How much?
- 📊 **Monthly balance chaos** — Who owes money? Who should get money back?
- ✍️ **Manual register errors** — Handwritten registers get messy, pages get lost

**Bachelor Meal System** solves all these problems with a clean, automated, and fair system that:

✅ Tracks every meal automatically  
✅ Records all bazar expenses by category  
✅ Calculates fair meal rates based on actual costs  
✅ Shows exactly who owes what at month-end  
✅ Works on any device with a browser

## 🎯 Why We Built This Project

In Bangladesh and many South Asian countries, bachelor flats are common. A group of friends or colleagues share a flat and cook together. Every day, someone goes to the bazar (market), someone cooks, and everyone eats.

But at the end of the month, **calculating who owes what** becomes a headache:

| Manual Approach Problems | Our Solution |
|--------------------------|--------------|
| Forgetting to note meals | One-click meal entry |
| Lost bazar receipts | Digital expense tracking |
| Unfair cost distribution | Automatic rate calculation |
| Arguments over money | Transparent balance sheet |
| Time wasted on calculations | Instant monthly summary |

**This system makes flat life peaceful!** 🏠✨
